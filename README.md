=========

A Löve2D workshop thingie.

This project sets up a simple simulation in Lua and Löve2D to simulate
tanks that can drive around on the screen and shoot each other. 

The AIs for the tanks can be worked out, right now, you must manually 
modify the world_init.lua script to create a world with specific AIs.
